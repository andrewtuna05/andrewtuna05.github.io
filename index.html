            <h2> About Me</h2>
            <p> Hi, I'm Andrew and I'm a Junior Electrical Engineering major at The Cooper Union in New York City. 
                I'm also pursuing a double minor in Mathematics and Computer Science.  <br>
                I’m passionate about optimization and stochastic processes— especially applying mathematical tools to tackle real-world challenges. After graduating from Cooper Union, I plan to pursue graduate studies in Applied Mathematics.
                This Summer, I will be at Cal Poly Pomona working with Dr. Jimmy Risk in Kernel Engineering with GPs and SVMs. <br><br>

                Outside of academia, I am a semi-professional badminton player. I'm a former member of the US Junior National Team and previously competed at the 2022 World Junior Championships. 
                In July, I'll be competing in Germany at the 2025 FISU World University Games.
