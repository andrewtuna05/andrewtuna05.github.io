        <h1> About Me</h1>
        <p> Hi, I'm Andrew and I'm a Senior Electrical Engineering Student at The Cooper Union in New York City. 
            I'm also pursuing a double minor in Mathematics and Computer Science. <br><br> 

            I’m passionate about optimization, stochastic processes, and machine learning— especially applying mathematical tools to tackle real-world challenges. 
            This Summer, I will be at Cal Poly Pomona working with Dr. Jimmy Risk in Kernel Engineering with GPs and SVMs. 
            Outside of academia, I am a semi-professional badminton player. I've competed at the 2022 World Junior Championships and am a former US and Pan Am junior champion.
            In July, I'll be competing in Germany at the 2025 FISU World University Games. Go Team USA!
            <br>
