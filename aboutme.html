        <p> I'm currently a Junior at The Cooper Union studying Electrical Engineering and pursuing a minor in Math. <br> <!--With a cumulative GPA of 3.9/4.0 and a Major/Minor GPA of 4.0, I've been named to the Dean's List every semester so far and --> I am a proud member of <a href="https://www.tbp.org/recruit/recruitHome.cfm" target="_blank"> Tau Beta Pi</a>.
        <br><!--I am grateful to have my hard work be acknowledged by my peers and faculty who have selected me to be the recipient of the Jesse Sherman EE'33 Book Award. -->

        <h3>Academic Experience</h3>
        <p> I'm passionate about learning and applying mathematics to solve real-world problems. After graduating from Cooper Union, I plan to pursue graduate studies in Applied Mathematics.
        I’ve had the opportunity to work as both a tutor and grader for the Mathematics Department at Cooper, where I enjoy helping students build intuition and confidence in their understanding of mathematical concepts.
        <!--<br><br> I am excited to work with Dr. Jimmy Risk this Summer at Cal Poly Pomona to learn about Kernel Engineering and the design and optimization of kernel functions. --> </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Programming">
        <p>I have moderate experience with programming <em>(as you can see from this stylish webpage)</em> but I am eager and curious to expand my skillset. <br><br> I have worked with languages such as: </p> 
    <ul>
        <li>C/C++</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>MATLAB</li>
        <li>SQL</li>

    </ul>
    <p>I'm hoping to become more fluent with these languages and more so I can utilize them for my EE and mathematics endeavors.</p>

        <h3>Relevant Coursework</h3>
        <p>I've built a strong foundation in both mathematics and electrical engineering through rigorous coursework. Some of these include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Calculus I-III </li>
            <li>Advanced Linear Algebra</li>
            <li>Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations</li>
            <li>Probability</li>
            <li>Modern Algebra</li>
            <li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
            <li>Convex Optimization <em>*Graduate Course</em></li>
            <li>Data Structures and Algorithms I & II</li>
            <li>Software Engineering and Large Systems Design</li>
            <li>Signal Processing</li>
            <li>Digital Signal Processing</li>
            <li>Circuit Analysis</li>
            <li>Electronics I & II</li>
            <li>Physics: Mechanics/Electricity & Magnetism/Optics & Quantum</li>
            <li>Finance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I plan to take Real Analysis, Bayesian Machine Learning, and Financial Signals Processing in my Senior year. Due to the small size of Cooper Union, I'm hoping more math electives open up!</p>

        <h3>Extracurriculars and Clubs</h3>
            <p>Don’t let the size fool you- Cooper Union has a vibrant student life, with many student-led clubs and organizations tons of student-led groups taking initiative and making things happen. 
            <br><br> With two of my friends, I co-founded the first North American Chapter of the International Finance Student Association (IFSA). 
            Despite starting in Fall of 2024, we quickly became one of the largest and active organizations- filling a gap for many students looking to break into Finance. </p>

            <img src="images/thumbnail_Image (17).jpg" height="320" width="460"/>

        <p>I'm also active in my school's badminton club, acting as the liason with Northeast Badminton Association and other badminton clubs. We host bi-weekly intramurals and recently hosted our first school-wide tournaments. </p>
