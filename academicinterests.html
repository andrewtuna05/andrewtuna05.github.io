        <h3>Academic Interests</h3>
        <p> I'm passionate about learning and applying mathematics to solve real-world problems especially in the field of Operations Research. After graduating from Cooper Union, I plan to pursue graduate studies in Applied Mathematics.
        I’ve had the opportunity to work as both a tutor and grader for the Mathematics Department at Cooper, where I enjoy helping students build intuition and confidence in their understanding of mathematical concepts.
        
        <br><br> I am excited to work with Dr. Jimmy Risk this Summer at Cal Poly Pomona to learn about Kernel Engineering and the design and optimization of kernel functions. </p>

        <h3>Extracurriculars and Clubs</h3>
            <p>Don’t let the size fool you- Cooper Union has a vibrant student life, with many student-led clubs and organizations tons of student-led groups taking initiative and making things happen. 
            <br><br> With two of my friends, I co-founded the first North American Chapter of the International Finance Student Association (IFSA). 
            Despite starting in Fall of 2024, we quickly became one of the largest and active organizations- filling a gap for many students looking to break into Finance. </p>

            <img src="images/thumbnail_Image (17).jpg" height="320" width="460"/>

        <p>I'm also active in my school's badminton club, acting as the liason with Northeast Badminton Association and other badminton clubs. We host bi-weekly intramurals and recently hosted our first school-wide tournaments. </p>
