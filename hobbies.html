        <h3>Badminton Player</h3>
        <p> As time-consuming as engineering can be, I like to be away from schoolwork and do activities that I enjoy.<br><br>
        For the past decade, I've been a professional badminton player and while I'm semi-retired now, I still occasionally compete in tournaments.</p>
        <h4>Some of My Achievements:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Highest USA Junior Rank: #1 </li>

        <p>I've traveled the world to train and compete in tournaments. Some countries I've been to include: Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Peru, Brazil, Spain, China, and Taiwan.

        <h3>Video Games</h3>
        <p>When I'm not practicing badminton, I like to play video games with my friends. <br><br>
        Some games that I play include: Counter-Strike, Osu, and very periodically- Teamfight Tactics. 
        <!--<br><br> Not to boast my upcoming esports career but I've peaked Immortal in Valorant, Unreal in Fortnite, and Emerald I in TFT. With Set 14 being released, I'm picking up TFT again and am hoping to reach a new peak. Wish me luck!-->
